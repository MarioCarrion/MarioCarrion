### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Computer Systems Engineer** with more than 15 years of professional Software Engineering and Software Development experience, I specialize in **Architecting** and **Implementing** Performant Real Time **Scalable Web Services**.

As a hands-on Backend Engineer and Technical Leader I've been lucky enough to manage, mentor and guide junior and experienced engineers, both collocated as well as distributed around the world in different timezones; in recent years I've been focused on using **Go** for building Web-based enterprise systems, using REST and gRPC.

During my career I've been able to work in different industries, delivering different types of production software, ranging from Real Time Automation Control Systems to Linux Accessibility APIs to Enterprise Advertising Web Applications.

Besides this Github Page you can also see my personal [Gitlab landing page](https://gitlab.com/MarioCarrion), over there I have more Open Source projects I'm currently maintaining and updating. Feel free to email me at `<blog><@><carrion.ws>` if you want to reach out to me.
