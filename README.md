# Hello and welcome ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mario; I'm a **Hands-on Software Architect** and **Lead Backend Engineer** with decades of Software Engineering and Software Development experience. I specialize in **Architecting** and **Implementing Performant real-time Scalable Web Services**.

Over the years, I've been lucky enough to manage, mentor, and guide junior and experienced engineers, both collocated and distributed across multiple time zones. In recent years, I've focused on using [**Go**](https://go.dev) and **Amazon Web Services** to build Web-based Enterprise Systems, using REST and gRPC.

During my career, I've been able to work in different industries, delivering various types of production software, such as on-premise Automation Systems, [Linux Accessibility](https://www.mono-project.com/archived/accessibility_team/) Desktop Applications, Cloud Governance and Compliance Systems, Media Streaming Services, and Highly Scalable Distributed Cloud-based Advertising Systems.

I also have a [Gitlab landing page](https://gitlab.com/MarioCarrion). Over there, I have more Open Source projects I'm currently maintaining and updating.

Feel free to reach out to me at: `<blog><@><carrion.ws>`.

**Keep it up, don't give up!**
